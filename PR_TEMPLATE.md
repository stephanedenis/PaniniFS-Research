# Pull Request: Fix Academic Style for Single Author Publication

## 🎯 **Summary**
Corrects the academic writing style in the main research paper to follow single-author conventions, replacing plural of modesty with appropriate impersonal and passive voice formulations.

## 📋 **Changes**

### **Modified Files**
- `docs/SYNTHESE_CONCEPTUELLE_INTEGRATIVE.md` - Academic paper style corrections

### **Key Improvements**
1. **Abstract**: "This paper presents..." ← "We present..."
2. **Introduction**: "This research investigates..." ← "We investigate..."  
3. **Methodology**: "Cross-linguistic phenomena were analyzed..." ← "We analyzed..."
4. **Implementation**: "Three components were implemented..." ← "We implemented..."
5. **Results**: "The analysis identified..." ← "Our analysis identified..."
6. **Acknowledgments**: "The author acknowledges..." ← "We acknowledge..."

## 🏆 **Academic Standards**
Follows conventions established by renowned single-author publications:
- Shannon (1948) - "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"
- Turing (1950) - "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"  
- Dijkstra (1968) - "Go To Statement Considered Harmful"
