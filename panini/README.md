# Panini Domain Knowledge

Purpose: Foundational linguistic, anatomical, phonological and conceptual research (the WHAT).

Subfolders:
- specs/: Canonical specifications (linguistic avatar, phonology frameworks, annotation schemas)
- discoveries/: Exploratory findings and analyses
- data/: Source datasets (raw, curated) NOT transformed for runtime
- references/: Bibliographic material, cached sources, citation manifests
- roadmap/: Conceptual domain roadmaps (no implementation tasks)

Separation Principle: No executable runtime code, builds, or engine assets here. Transformations happen in tech/.
