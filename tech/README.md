# Tech Implementation

Purpose: Implementation assets, applications, build scripts, validation tooling (the HOW).

Subfolders:
- specs/: Technical specs (engine, data pipeline, extension schemas)
- discoveries/: Engineering spikes, performance notes
- data/: Derived / runtime-ready JSON (generated from panini/data)
- references/: Technical standards snapshots (glTF, APIs) separate from domain references
- roadmap/: Iterative engineering roadmaps (sprints, milestones)
- apps/: Interactive tools and validators
- scripts/: Maintenance, build, validation automation
- tests/: Test suites (js, py)
- assets/: Models, images, presets, compiled artifacts
- docs/: Architecture, API, migration guides

Rule: Do not store raw scientific sources; generate everything here from panini/.
