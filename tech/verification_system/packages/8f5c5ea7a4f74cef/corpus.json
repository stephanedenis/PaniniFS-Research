We show that neither the minimal nor maximal tensor norms are\ndefinable uniformly over all C*-algebras. The proof in the case of the minimal\ntensor product norm uses a deep theorem of Kirchberg characterizing exactness\nin terms of tensor products with matrix ultraproducts while the case of maximal\ntensor products uses Pisier's recent characterization of the lifting property\nin terms of maximal tensor products and ultraproducts. We also study the\nquestion of when one of these tensor products can be definable in a particular\nC*-algebra. We establish some negative results along these lines for particular\nC*-algebras and when the definability condition is strengthened to be\ncomputable and of a restricted quantifier-complexity; these results use the\nquantum complexity results MIP$^*$=RE and MIP$^{co}=$coRE.

To address these challenges, here we propose\na deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive\nparameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of\nHamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of\nparameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics.

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative\nto integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor\ntrajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

    "title": "CausalPre: Scalable and Effective Data Pre-processing for Causal\n  Fairness",
    "abstract": "Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate\noutcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute\nrelationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the\nconventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off\nrelationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence\nclasses under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped\nphase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We\ngeneralize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at\nfinite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct\na channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another\nprovided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a\ncertain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of\nlinear size $L$ and approximation error $\\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit\nis ${\\rm polylog}({\\rm poly}(L)/\\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition,\nwhich we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many\nnoncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry\nbreaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in\nthe same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently\npreserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing\nself-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the\nproof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode\ninformation into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.",

    "title": "Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices",
    "abstract": "The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in\noperator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as\nentanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new\nconvex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual\nto the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a\ncomplete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant\nmaps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP,\nthereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of\ncopositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous\nframework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary\napplication of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps\n$\\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive\nexact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or\ndecomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic\nparameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive\nindecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from\ninfinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as\nPaley graphs.\n  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes\nof symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares\n(SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of\ncopositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for\ndifferent levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this\nduality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke\nstates that are simultaneously entangled and $\\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic\nextendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \\geq 2$ and local dimension $n\n\\geq 5$.",

    "title": "Strong converse exponent of channel interconversion",
    "abstract": "In their seminal work, Bennett et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (2002)] showed\nthat, with sufficient shared randomness, one noisy channel can simulate another\nat a rate equal to the ratio of their capacities. We establish that when coding\nabove this channel interconversion capacity, the exact strong converse exponent\nis characterized by a simple optimization involving the difference of the\ncorresponding R\\'enyi channel capacities with H\\\"older dual parameters. We\nfurther extend this result to the entanglement-assisted interconversion of\nclassical-quantum channels, showing that the strong converse exponent is\nlikewise determined by differences of sandwiched R\\'enyi channel capacities.\nThe converse bound is obtained by relaxing to non-signaling assisted codes and\napplying H\\\"older duality together with the data processing inequality for\nR\\'enyi divergences. Achievability is proven by concatenating refined channel\ncoding and simulation protocols that go beyond first-order capacities,\nattaining an exponentially small conversion error, remaining robust under small\nvariations in the input distribution, and tolerating a sublinear gap between\nthe conversion rates.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SamBa-GQW, a novel quantum algorithm for solving binary\ncombinatorial optimization problems of arbitrary degree with no use of any\nclassical optimizer. The algorithm is based on a continuous-time quantum walk\non the solution space represented as a graph.

The key novelty of our algorithm is an offline classical\nsampling protocol that gives information about the spectrum of the problem\nHamiltonian. Then, the extracted information is used to guide the walker to\nhigh quality solutions via a quantum walk with a time-dependent hopping rate.\nWe investigate the performance of SamBa-GQW on several quadratic problems,\nnamely MaxCut, maximum independent set, portfolio optimization, and\nhigher-order polynomial problems such as LABS, MAX-$k$-SAT and a quartic\nreformulation of the travelling salesperson problem. We empirically demonstrate\nthat SamBa-GQW finds high quality approximate solutions on problems up to a\nsize of $n=20$ qubits by only sampling $n^2$ states among $2^n$ possible\ndecisions.
