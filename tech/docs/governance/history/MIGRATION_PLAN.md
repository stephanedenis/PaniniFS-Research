# Repository Migration Plan (Dual Axis: Domain vs Tech)

Status: Phase P4 COMPLETED â€“ Updated 2025-09-10 UTC
Scope: Define mapping from current layout to target structure separating domain knowledge (panini/) and technical implementation (tech/).

## 1. Principles
- Separation of concerns: WHAT (linguistic, anatomical, conceptual research) vs HOW (software, tooling, runtime assets)
- No symbolic links; history preserved via `git mv` when executed.
- English normalized naming (snake_case for directories & multiword files, lowercase).
- Versioned data: raw domain datasets in panini/data, derived/runtime in tech/data or tech/assets.
- Incremental phases with stability gates; tests updated before removing originals.

## 2. Target Top-Level
```
panini/
  specs/ discoveries/ data/ references/ roadmap/ methodology/ publications/
tech/
  specs/ discoveries/ data/ references/ roadmap/ apps/ scripts/ tests/ assets/ docs/
shared/ (future: governance, licenses)
```

## 3. Mapping Table (Phase Priority)

## 4. Phases
- P1: Core specs & models & validator app & tests & critical scripts.
- P2: Demos, vendor libs, detailed guides, dataset split (source vs runtime), deployment guide.
- P3: Reports, governance docs, strategy, image organization, cleanup.
- P4: Remove old empty dirs, update references, enforce path checks.

## 5. Conventions
| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Directories | snake_case lowercase |
| Specs filenames | <topic>_requirements.md or <topic>_spec.md |
| Versioned JSON (domain source) | name_v<major>_<minor>.json |
| Runtime JSON (tech derived) | name.v<major>.<minor>.json |
| Models | <module>_rig_v<major>.<minor>.glb |
| Reports | <date>_<topic>_report.md (ISO date optional) |
| Scripts | verb_object.py / validate_<area>.py |

## 6. Validation Checklist Before Each Phase
- All moved files referenced in README / scripts updated.
- Tests pass (tech/tests) after path changes.
- No orphan large binaries >10MB left outside target axes.
- Git diff free of accidental deletions (only renames/moves).

## 7. Rollback Strategy
- If failure mid-phase: revert branch to previous commit (no partial manual undo).
- Keep branch `migration/dual-axis` until full completion and review.

## 8. Outstanding Decisions
- Whether to separate panini/publications vs root publications (decided: consolidate under panini/).
- Introduce `shared/` later; currently not created.
- Potential schema generation pipeline location (likely tech/scripts/build/).

## 9. Execution Log
### Phase P1 (Completed 2025-09-10 UTC)
Scope executed:
- Discoveries: baby_sign_validation, dhatu_universals relocated to `panini/discoveries/`
- Methodology protocols relocated to `panini/methodology/protocols/`
- Publications (articles, books) flattened & relocated to `panini/publications/`
- Validator app relocated to `tech/apps/validator/`
- JS tests relocated to `tech/tests/js/`
- Python tests relocated to `tech/tests/py/`
- 3D model assets relocated to `tech/assets/models/`
- Critical scripts (hash generator, validation script) relocated to `tech/scripts/`
- Navigation doc relocated to `tech/docs/navigation.md`
Validation summary:
- Structural moves staged & committed under single commit `chore(migration): Phase P1 ...`
- No vendor libs / demos moved yet (reserved for P2)
- Next: Phase P2 (demos, vendor libs, dataset source/runtime split, guides)

Pending items for P2 start conditions:
1. Update internal relative paths in any scripts referencing old test or model locations (TBD after initial test run)
2. Introduce `tech/assets/vendor/` and move three.min.js, GLTFLoader.js, dat.gui.min.js
3. Split handshape & nmf rules JSON (source vs runtime)
4. Relocate demo HTML pages into `tech/apps/demos/`
5. Prepare data provenance notes for moved JSON assets

Phase P3 & P4 remain unchanged.

### Phase P2 (Completed 2025-09-10 UTC)
Executed:
1. Demos & prototypes relocated: `tech/apps/demos/` (+ archive/) with snake_case names.
2. Vendor libs centralized: `tech/assets/vendor/` (three.min.js, dat.gui.min.js, GLTFLoader.js).
3. Raw dataset moved: `research/dhatu/` -> `panini/data/dhatu/`.
4. Data split (source vs runtime) for handshapes & NMF rules.
5. Guide relocation: deployment guide & advanced hands spec.
6. Images organized: debug & error PNG sets relocated.
7. Tests consolidated: all JS & Py tests moved under `tech/tests/`.
8. Path normalization in demos (vendor references updated).
9. Verification script extended (`verify_layout.sh`).
10. Migration plan updated and committed.

Validation:
- No root test files or legacy vendor scripts remain.
- Layout verifier updated with P2 assets & passes locally.
- All mapping entries for P2 now realized.

Phase Closure Risks Mitigated:
- Stray root assets removed.
- Source/runtime JSON naming conventions enforced.

Transition: Commencing Phase P3 (governance docs, reports, roadmap/strategy, image governance, cleanup).

### Phase P3 (Completed 2025-09-10 UTC)
Executed:
- Governance rules relocation.
- Reports relocation (tests & validation status).
- Strategy document relocation.
- Verifier extended (governance/reports/roadmap checks).
- Image assets policy added (`tech/docs/governance/image_assets_policy.md`).
- Layout verification passed.

Outcome: Ready for final cleanup & enforcement.

### Phase P4 (Completed 2025-09-10 UTC)
Executed:
- Legacy directories `interactive-validator/` and `language/` archived (tar) then removed.
- Verifier updated to assert absence of legacy directories.
- Final verification pass successful after cleanup.
- Migration plan finalized with all phases logged.

Final State Guarantees:
- Domain axis (`panini/`) contains only research, specs, data sources, roadmap.
- Tech axis (`tech/`) contains all runtime assets, apps, tests, scripts, docs, governance.
- No root-level stray test, vendor, or image files.
- Source/runtime data split established and enforced.

Next (Post-Migration) Recommendations:
1. Add CI job invoking `tech/scripts/validation/verify_layout.sh`.
2. Introduce lint rule / pre-commit hook to block root-level *.png, test-*.js, vendor libs.
3. Document developer onboarding referencing this plan (convert to archived doc or keep live for governance).
