• Mathematical notation parsing and dhatu mapping
• Performance estimation and scaling analysis
• Peer verification and reproducibility system

EXECUTION RESULTS:
• All phases completed successfully
• Comprehensive analysis report generated
• Verification packages created for peer review
• Open data sources used throughout

REPRODUCIBILITY:
• All analyses verifiable through peer verification system
• Complete processing logs maintained
• Transparent methodology documented
• Results reproducible across environments

SCIENTIFIC RIGOR:
• Open data sources (ArXiv.org)
• Deterministic algorithms
• Comprehensive verification
• Peer review ready
